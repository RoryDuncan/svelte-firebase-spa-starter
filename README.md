A Svelte.js and Firebase starter project for building an SPA

# Getting Started

Before you start, it's optimal to use [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit), since it will remove all of the fluff around this repository. Without it you will need to manually remove files.

```
npm install -g degit
```
